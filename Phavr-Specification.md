**User/Login**
- [] The fbLogin is responsible for Facebook authentication for the user, do not remove it from the button.
- [] Store the user's token in the local storage for persistent login, remove on logout.
- [] Shouldn't have the button bar in the login page
- [] Shouldn't be navigated to from anywhere inside the main application

**Profile**
- [] No voting on the profile page. That would be silly.
- [] Should have the user's name, photo, and favors

**Push notifications**
- [] There should be a list of all the recent push notifications
- [] Have preferences for the notifications as to not annoy the user
